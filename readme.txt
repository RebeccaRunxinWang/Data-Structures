I did Implement Dijkstra's algorithm, Integrate Dijkstra and the GUI and Maze with graphs and breadth-first search. 

1. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm
I implemented the Dijkstra's algorithm in Dijkstra.java. It should be tested using TestDijkstra.java, which has tested the implementation by calling printDistance(), printPath(node) and printAllPath() methods.

2. Integrate Dijkstra and the GUI
I did the integration in GraphGUI.java, which is based on the code we used in class. It works with GraphComponent.java which draws a picture of a graph, and PlacedData.java. They should be tested using GraphGUI.java, and the user can click a node then press a button marked Shortest distance. There is also a reset button. 

3. Maze
I write the maze class  in MazeGraph.java, and it uses MazeContents.java and MazeData.java. MazeData is similar to Placed Data. It should be tested using MazeSolver.java, and it allows user to types mazefile name into the box in the GUI. I have the shortest path showed in orange. You can use the mazetestdata as input file to test it, though it has many mazes in it, just like the assigment for maze.
